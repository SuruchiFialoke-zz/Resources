## Must Check/ Classics

1. [Coursera Machine Learning Course Taught by:  Andrew Ng, Co-founder, Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&campaignid=693373197&adgroupid=36745103515&device=c&keyword=andrew%20ng%20machine%20learning&matchtype=e&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=1t1&creativeid=156061453588&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CLrKuey1htUCFVlXDQodMU0NUA)

2. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning, a free online book by Michael Nielsen] 


## Online courses
 
1. [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/about-us) **python** : I have used DataQuest for most of my initial projects and found them absolutely amazing. Very thoughtfully curated content and great GUI, very highly recommend.

2. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) **python and R**: Haven't personally used it, but heard good things about it. 

2. [DataSchool](http://www.dataschool.io/) **python**: Haven't done the paid courses, but followed along a few tutorials by the founder Kevin Markham. One of the best instructor out there. His succinct and clear way of explaining things is very helpful if you are a beginner. Highly recommend.  

3. [Youtube tutorial series](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/) and [Online resourses](https://pythonprogramming.net/ ) **python** : by a Freelancer/youtuber Harrison. I would recommend it for people who have some basics down for a smoother experience on his channel, reason being his freeform and less prescriptive way of teaching. His tutorials are most helpful when you code things along with him. One of the few online resources that cover most of the advanced topics in MachineLearning.
